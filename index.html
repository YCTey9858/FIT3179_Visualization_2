        <h1>World Health and Life Statistic</h1>
        <p>The topic of this visualisation is <strong>world health statistic</strong> of the world (countries that recognised by WHO). Thus, we will be investigating health index of each countries from different aspect 
          including <strong>healthcare service and infrastructure</strong>, <strong>life expectancy</strong>, <strong>workforces</strong>, <strong>basic living infrastructure index</strong>, <strong>death rates</strong> from <strong>mental</strong>, <strong>air pollution</strong>, and <strong>accident</strong>.</p>

          <h2>World Universal Health Coverage Index of Service Coverage</h2>
          <p>Universal Health Coverage Index is is an index reported on a unitless scale of <strong><span style="color:LightGreen;">0</span>  to <span style="color:DarkGreen;">100</span></strong>, which is computed as the geometric mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage. 
          From the map, we can observe that developed country such as <strong>United States, Canada, Australia</strong> are having a high UHC index above <span style="color:DarkGreen;"><strong>80</strong></span> in 2015. 
            This means that these countries are having nice healthcare service and infrastructure for their citizen. Thus, the higher the UHC index, the people in that country will be more healthier.</p>

          <h2>Life Statistics</h2>
          <p>From the bubble chart below with taking both sexes in the year <strong>2019</strong> as references, we can observe that countries in <span style="color:LightSkyBlue;"><strong>Europe</strong></span> are having the highest life expectancy, whereas countries in <span style="color:FireBrick;"><strong>Africa</strong></span> are having the lowest life expectancy. From the aspect of HALE expectancy, the countries in <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod;"><strong>Western Pacific</strong></span> are with the greatest value, where the countries in <span style="color:FireBrick;"><strong>Africa</strong></span> are with the lowest. When we are discussing the percentage of HALE in life expectancy, i.e. how many years are they being healthy in their whole life, every region is having the value around the average, which is <strong>86.83%</strong>. And among all these regions, <span style="color:DarkGoldenRod;"><strong>Western Pacific</strong></span> is having the greatest percentage of HALE in life expectancy.</p>

          <h2>Healthcare Workforce</h2>
          <p>From the radial graph below, we are taking the <strong>Republic of Korea</strong> as country selection and data in 2017 for referencing. Since the <strong>Republic of Korea</strong> is in the region of <strong>Western Pacific</strong>, from the chart above we can know that the percentage of HALE in life expectancy is <strong>88%</strong>, which is the highest. It makes sense to have lots of people in that country as part of the healthcare workforce. Among 10000 people in the healthcare workforce, <strong>71.2</strong> of people are taking nursing as their occupation, <strong>23.61</strong> as a doctor, <strong>7.24</strong> as a pharmacist, and <strong>4.95</strong> as a dentist.</p>

          <h2>Basic Living Infrastructure Coverage</h2>
          <p>From the Parallel coordinate chart of <strong>2017</strong> below, we can observe that most of the parallel lines starting from line 1 are spreading around the upper <strong>20%</strong>. This indicates that most of the country does provide basic drinking-water services. At line 2, we can see that some parallel lines are having a trend of <strong>decrease</strong>. This shows that some countries are not providing basic sanitation services. At line 3, we can observe that the spreadness of parallel lines is <strong>two-sided</strong>. This means that most countries will have either high primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies or no primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies.

          <p>According to the bar chart in <strong>2016</strong> as shown below, we are discussing three pieces of data. For the first part, which is <strong>crude suicide rates</strong> per 100000 population in the world, <strong>India</strong> is having the highest rate, and <strong>Guyana</strong> is having the secong highest rate. For the second part, which is <strong>air pollution</strong> death rate per 100000 population in the world and take all diseases caused into account, <strong>Sierra Leone</strong> is having the highest rate, and <strong>Nigeria</strong> is having the second highest rate. For the last part, which is the <strong>road traffic</strong> death rate per 100000 population in the world, <strong>Liberia</strong> is having the highest rate, and <strong>Saint Lucia</strong> is having the second highest rate.</p>
